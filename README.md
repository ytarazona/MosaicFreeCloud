## Description
This script called "MosaicFreeCloud" generates cloud-free mosaics from more than two images from different satellite sensors (e.g., Landsat, MODIS). The names of the images that enter the script must have the following form: L8003069_20170919_NDVI.tif.

Where,
- L8: are the initials of the sensor.
- 003069: They are the path and row of the Landsat scene.
- 20170919: it is the date of acquisition of the image. In this example it is an image of September 19, 2017.
- NDVI: is a name of the type of variable that we are processing.
