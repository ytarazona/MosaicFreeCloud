##MosaicFreeCloud

This algorithm allows to generate a cloud-free mosaic from multiple satellite images of a single band for now. It is very important that the name of the images have for example this form: "L5002069_20000727_NDVI.tif". Where "L5002069" indicates the sensor and the path / row of the Landsat image in this case, while "20000727" indicates the date of acquisition of the image (for example in this case it is an image of July 27, 2000).
